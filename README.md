This project is a quickly made MVP to demonstrate the practical application of my Master's dissertation. 

In this project, data from ARKit and Vision frameworks goes through several processing steps, including:

- Extraction of key features
- Motion segmentation
- Noise filtering
- Application of DTW and Euclidean distance
- Normalization

This processing is used to determine human movements.
